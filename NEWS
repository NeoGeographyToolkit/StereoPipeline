*** RELEASE 2.4.0, 28 April, 2014 ***

  - Added wv_correct, a tool for correcting artifacts in Digital Globe
    WorldView-1 and WorldView-2 images with TDI of 16.
  - Added logging to a file for stereo, pc_align, point2dem, 
    point2mesh, point2las, and dem_geoid.
  - Added a tutorial for processing Digital Globe Earth imagery
    and expanded the MOC tutorial.
  - Bug fixes in mosacking of Digital Globe images.

  - parallel_stereo
     * Use dynamic load balancing for improved performance.
     * Automatically determine the optimal number of processes
       and threads for each stage of stereo.

  - stereo_pprc
     * Added the --skip-image-normalization option (for non-ISIS 
       images and alignment-method none), it can help with reducing
       the size of data on disk and performance.
       
  - stereo_rfne
     * Added new affine subpixel refinement mode when 
       --subpixel-mode = 3. This mode sacrifices the error resistance
       of Bayes EM mode in exchange for reduced computation time.
       For some data sets this can perform as well as Bayes EM in
       about one fifth the time.

  - stereo_fltr:
     * Hole-filling is disabled by default in stereo_fltr. It is 
       suggested to use instead point2dem's analogous functionality.
       It can be re-enabled using --enable-fill-holes.
     * Added the option --erode-max-size to remove isolated blobs.
     * Relaxed filtering of disparities, retaining more valid
       disparities. Can be adjusted with --filter-mode and related
       parameters.

  - stereo_tri:
    * Added ability to save triangulation error for a DEM as a 3D
      North-East-Down vector rather than just its magnitude.
    * When acting on map-projected images, handle the case when the 
      DEM used for map-projection does not completely encompass the 
      images.
 
  - pc_align:
    * Read and write CSV files in a wide variety of formats, using 
      the --csv-format option.
    * Display the translation component of the rigid alignment
      transform in the local North-East-Down coordinate system, as
      well as the centroid of source points used in alignment.
    * Save to disk the convergence history (iteration information).
    * Added the ability to explicitly specify the datum semi-axes.
    * Bug fix for saving transformed clouds for Moon and Mars.
    * More efficient processing of reference and source points
      by loading only points in each cloud within a neighborhood
      of the long/lat bounding box of the other cloud.
    * Make it possible to generate ortho and error images using
      point2dem with the transformed clouds output by pc_align.

  - point2dem:
     * Replaced the core algorithm. Instead of sampling the point
       cloud surface, which is prone to aliasing, the DEM height at a
       given grid point is obtained as a weighted average of heights
       of all points in the cloud within search radius of the grid
       point, with the weights given by a Gaussian. The cutoff of the
       Gaussian can be controlled using the --search-radius-factor
       option. The old algorithm is still available (but obsoleted)
       using the --use-surface-sampling option. The new algorithm
       makes the --fsaa option redundant. 
     * Added the ability to remove outliers by triangulation error,
       either automatically (--remove-outliers) or manually, with 
       given error threshold (--max-valid-triangulation-error).
     * Added two algorithms to fill holes in the output DEM and 
       orthoimage (--hole-fill-mode).
     * The way the default DEM spacing is computed was modified, 
       to make dependent only on the local distribution of points
       in the cloud and robust to outliers. 
     * Can handle highly noisy input point clouds without spikes in 
       memory usage and processing time.
     * Improved memory usage and performance for large point clouds.
     * Bug fix, the DEM was shifted by 1 pixel from true location.

*** RELEASE 2.3.0, 19 November, 2013 ***

TOOLS

  - Added pc_align, a tool for aligning point clouds, using the
    libpointmacher library
    (https://github.com/ethz-asl/libpointmatcher). Sparse and dense
    point clouds are supported, as well as DEMs. Two ICP methods are
    supported, point-to-plane and point-to-point. Memory and processing
    usage are proportional to the desired number of input points
    to use rather than to the overall input data sizes.

  - Added lronac2mosaic.py, a tool for merging the LE and RE images
    from the LRONAC camera into a single map-projected image.  The
    output images can be fed into the stereo tool to generate DEMs.
  
  - rpc_maprpoject and orthoproject are combined into a single tool
    for projecting a camera image onto a DEM for any camera model
    supported by Stereo Pipeline. The old orthoproject is kept for 
    backward compatibility for a while.

GENERAL 


  - Stereo Pipeline (almost) daily and fully verfied builds for all
    platforms are available for the adventurous user
    (http://byss.arc.nasa.gov/stereopipeline/daily_build/). When
    requesting support, please provide the output of "stereo --version".

  - The size of Stereo Pipeline output data has been reduced, by up to
    40%, particularly point clouds and DEMs are between 30% to 70%
    smaller.  Better encoding is used, output data is rounded (up to 1
    mm), and point clouds are offset and saved as float instead of
    double.
    
  - Timeout option added for stereo correlation, preventing
    unreasonably long correlation times for certain image tiles.

  - Subpixel mosaicing in dg_mosaic uses bilinear interpolation
    instead of nearest neighbor avoiding artifacts in certain
    situations.

  - dg_mosaic can generate a combined RPC model in addition to the
    combined DG model. It accepts flags for specifying input and 
    output nodata values.

  - point2dem with the --fsaa option for reducing aliasing at
    low-resolution DEM generation has been improved as to remove the
    erosion of of valid data close to no-data values.

  - Bugfixes for parallel_stereo, point2dem, etc. 

*** RELEASE 2.2.2, 17 MAY 2013 ***
    (incremented from 2.2.1 after one more bugfix)

TOOLS
 - stereo_mpi renamed to parallel_stereo and made to work
   on any machines with shared storage, rather than just on

   identification.

   Boost MPI. This is experimental development code and is not used for
   anything in binary release yet.

PHOTOMETRYTK
 - Added new optional module call the Photometry Toolkit. This is
   experimental development code and is not use for anything released
   in the binary yet. This code focuses on future research of massive
   mosaics (+100GB) and the ability to perform basic photometric corrections.
