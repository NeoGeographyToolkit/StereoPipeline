*** RELEASE 2.6.X, TBA ***

 - New satellites
   Support Cartosat-1 and Perusat-1 RPC cameras.

 - stereo_corr
   * Added new options for post-SGM subpixel stereo.
     Previously only a parabola method was used.
   * Added option to perform cross-correlation checks on
     multiple resolution levels while using SGM/MGM.
   * Added option --corr-search-limit to constrain the 
     automatically computed correlation search range.
   * Added --corr-memory-limit-mb option to limit the
     memory usage of the SGM/MGM algorithms.
   * Improved search range estimation in nadir epipolar 
     alignment cases. Added --elevation-limit option to
     help constrain this search range.
   * Added hybrid SGM/MGM stereo option.
   * Improvements to SGM search range estimation.
   * Added --min-num-ip option.
   
 - bundle_adjust
   * The tool is a lot more sensitive now to --camera-weight,
     existing results may change a lot.  
   * Added the parameters --rotation-weight and --translation-weight
     to penalize large rotation and translation changes. For example
     bundle_adjust can effectively constrain the adjustments to be
     translation only.

   * Added the parameter --nodata-value. 

 - stereo_gui
   * Can view SPOT5 .BIL files.

 - pc_align
   * Add the ability to help the tool with an initial translation,
     to be used for gross offsets. The option is --initial-ned-translation. 

 - Misc
   * Handle properly in bundle_adjust, orbitviz, and stereo 
     with mapprojected images the case when, for RPC cameras,
     these coefficients are stored in _RPC.TXT files.
   * Support for web-based PROJ.4 strings, e.g., 
     point2dem --t_srs http://spatialreference.org/ref/iau2000/49900/
   * Added --max-output-size option to point2dem to prevent against
     creation of too large DEMs.
   
*** RELEASE 2.6.0, May 15, 2017 ***

 - New stereo algorithms
   * ASP now supports the Semi Global Matching (SGM) and 
     More Global Matching (MGM) stereo algorithms. 
     They do particularly well for Earth imagery, better 
     than the present approaches. They can be invoked with 
     --stereo-algorithm 1 and 2 respectively. 

 - New tools
    * Added cam2rpc, a tool to create an RPC model from any
      ASP-supported camera. Such cameras can be used with ASP for
      Earth and planetary data (stereo's --datum option must be set),
      or passed to third-party stereo tools S2P and SETSM. 
    * Added correct_icebridge_l3_dem for IceBridge.
    * Added fetch_icebridge_data for IceBridge.

 - parallel_stereo
   * By default, use as many processes as there are cores, and one
     thread per processes.
     
 - stereo_pprc
   * Large speedup in epipolar alignment.
   * Improved epipolar alignment quality with standard pinhole cameras.
   * Added the options --ip-inlier-threshold and --ip-uniqueness-threshold
     for finer-grained control over interest point generation.
   * Fix a bug with interest point matching the camera model is RPC
     and the RPC approximation domain does not itersect the datum.
  
 - stereo_corr
   * Added new option --stereo-algorithm.  Choices 1 and 2 replaces
     the standard integer correlator with a new semi-global matching 
     (SGM) correlator or an MGM correlator respectively.  SGM/MGM is
     slow and memory intensive but it can produce better results
     for some challenging input images, especially for IceBridge.
     See the manual for more details.

 - stereo_tri
  * Added the option --min-triangulation-angle to not triangulate
    when rays have an angle less than this. 
 
 - stereo_gui
  * Zooming in one image can trigger all other side-by-side images to
    zoom to same region.
  * Clicking on a pixel prints image pixel indicies, value, and image 
    name. Selecting a region with Control+Mouse prints its bounds in 
    pixels, and, if georeferenced, in projected and degree units. 
  * Added a 1D profile tool for DEMs.
  * Can visualize the pixel locations for a GCP file (by interpretting
    them as interest points).
  * Can save a screenshot of the current view.
  * If all images are in the same window, can show a given image above
    or below all others. Also can zoom to bring any image in full view
    (from the list of images on the left).
  * Options to set the azimuth and elevation when showing hillshaded 
    images.

 - dem_mosaic
   * Added the option --dem-blur-sigma to blur the output DEM.
   * Use by default --weights-exponent 2 to improve the blending,
     and increase this to 3 if --priority-blending-length is specified.
   * Added the options --tile-list, --block-max, and --nodata-threshold. 
   * Display the number of valid pixels written. 
   * Do not write empty tiles. 

 - geodiff
   * One of the two input files can be in CSV format.

 - dg_mosaic
    * Save on output the mean values for MEANSUNEL, MEANSUNAZ,
      and a few more.

 - point2dem
     * Added the parameter --gaussian-sigma-factor to control the 
       Gaussian kernel width when creating a DEM (to be used together
       with --search-radius-factor).

 - sfs
    * Improvements, speedups, bug fixes, more documentation, usage
      recipes, much decreased memory usage, together with a lot of
      testing and validation for the Moon.
    * Can run on multiple input DEM clips (which can be chosen as
      representative for the desired large input DEM region and images)
      to solve for adjusted camera positions throughout this region.
    * Added parallel_sfs, to run sfs as multiple processes over
      multiple machines.

 - bundle_adjust
    * Can optimize the intrinsic parameters for pinhole cameras. The
      focal length, optical center, and distortion parameters can
      be fixed or varied independently of each other. To be used with
      --local-pinhole, --solve-intrinsics, --intrinsics-to-float.
    * Added the option --overlap-list. It can be used to specify which
      image pairs are expected to overlap and hence to be used to
      compute matches.
    * Added the option --initial-transform to initialize the adjustments
      based on a 4x4 rotation + translation transform, such as coming
      from pc_align. 
   * Added the options --ip-inlier-threshold and --ip-uniqueness-threshold
     for finer-grained control over interest point generation.

 - pc_align
   * Can solve for a rotation + translation or for rotation +
     translation + scale using least squares instead of ICP, if the
     first cloud is a DEM. It is suggested that the input clouds be 
     very close or otherwise the --initial-transform option be used,
     for the method to converge. The option is:
     --alignment-method [ least-squares | similarity-least-squares ]

 - Misc
  * Built with ISIS 3.5.0.
  * Minimum supported OS versions are OSX 10.11, RHEL 6, SUSE 12, and
    Ubuntu 14.
  * Ship with GDAL's gdalwarp and gdaldem.
  * Added integration with Zenodo so that this and all future ASP 
	releases wil have a DOI.  More info in the asp_book.pdf

*** RELEASE 2.5.3, August 24, 2016 ***

Highlights
 
 - Added the ability to process ASTER L1A VNIR images via the tool
   aster2asp that creates image files and both RPC and rigorous
   linescan camera models that can then be passed to stereo.
   The RPC model seems to work just as well as the rigorous one
   and is much faster.

 - Added the ability to process SPOT5 images with stereo,
   bundle_adjust, and map_project using a rigorous linescan camera model.
 - Added the add_spot_rpc tool to create RPC models for SPOT5
   which allows them to be map projected with the RPC model.

 - pc_align 
   * Can solve for a scale change in addition to a rotation and translation 
     to best align two clouds, hence for a similarity transform. 
     Option: --alignment-method similarity-point-to-point

 - mapproject
   * Added ability to map project color images.
   * Added option to map project on to a flat datum.

 - camera_solve
   * Added option to accept multiple input camera models.

Other

 - dem_mosaic
   * Fix a bug with mosaicking of DEMs over very large extent.
   * Fix a bug with 360 degree longitude offset.
   * Added the option --use-centerline-weights. It will compute
     blending weights based on a DEM centerline algorithm. Produces 
     smoother weights if the input DEMs don't have holes or complicated
     boundary.

 - colormap
   * Added a new colormap scheme, 'cubehelix', that works better for
     most color-blind people.

 - stereo_gui
   * Use transparent pixels for displaying no-data values instead of black.
   * Can delete or hillshade individual images when overlayed.
   * Add control to hide/show all images when in overlay mode.

 - Misc
   * Make ASP handle gracefully georeferenced images with some pixels
     having projected coordinates outside of the range expected by PROJ.4.
   * Removed the deprecated orthoproject tool. Now mapproject should be used. 
   * Fixed a bug in pc_align which caused the --max-disp argument to be misread
     in some situations.
   * Removed some extraneous code slowing down the datum_convert tool.
   * Fixed a bug in point2dem handling the Albers Conic Equal Area projection.
   * Added standard thread/bigtiff/LZW options to image_calc.
 
*** RELEASE 2.5.2, Feb 29, 2016 ***

Highlights

- Added a constellation of features and tools to support solving for
  the positions of input images lacking position information.  Can be used
  for aerial imagery with inaccurate or incomplete pose information,
  images from low cost drones, historical images lacking metadata, 
  and images taken with handheld cameras.

 - camera_solve
   * New tool which adds support for aerial imagery etc as described above.
   * Uses the THEIA library (http://www.theia-sfm.org/index.html)
     to compute camera positions and orientations where no metadata is available. 
   * Ground control points and estimated camera positions
     can be used to find absolute camera positions.
    * Added section to documentation describing ways to use ASP to 
      process imagery from NASA's IceBridge program.

 - camera_calibrate
    * A convenience camera calibration tool that is a wrapper around
      the OpenCV checkerboard calibration program with outputs in
      formats for camera_solve and ASP.

 - bundle_adjust
    * Added several options to support solving for pinhole camera
      models in local coordinates using GCPs or estimated camera positions.
    * Improved filtering options for which images are IP-matched.

 - orbitviz
    * Significantly improved the accuracy of the plotted camera locations.
    * Added option to load results from camera_solve.

 - wv_correct
    * Now corrects TDI 8 (Reverse) of WV01 and TDI 8 (Forward 
      and Reverse) and TDI 32 (Forward) of WV02.  Other correction
      behavior is unchanged.

 - stereo_corr
   * Added the ability to filter large disparities from D_sub that 
     can greatly slow down a run. The options are --rm-quantile-percentile
     and --rm-quantile-multiple. 

 - undistort_image
    * A new tool to test out pinhole model lens distortion parameters.
    
 - Lens distortion models:
    * Switched from binary .pinhole file format to updated version of
      the old plain text .tsai file format.
    * Added support for Photometrix camera calibration parameters.
    * New appendix to the documentation describing the .tsai file format
      and supported lens distortion models.
    
Other

 - Tools
    * Suppressed pesky aux.xml warning sometimes printed by GDAL.
    * Removed the long-deprecated orthoproject tool.
    * Added icebridge_kmz_to_csv and lvis2kml utilities.

 - point2las
    * Write correct bounding box in the header.
    * Respect projections that are not lon-lat.

 - point2dem
    * Increased speed of erode option.
   
 - docs
    * Mention DERT, a tool for exploring large DEMs.
    * Added new section describing camera_solve tool in detail.

*** RELEASE 2.5.1, November 13, 2015 ***

Highlights

 - stereo
    * Added jitter correction for Digital Globe linescan imagery.
    * Bugfix for stereo with map-projected images using the RPC
      session (e.g, for map-projected Pleiades imagery).
    * Added OpenCV-based SIFT and ORB interest point finding options.

 - bundle_adjust
    * Much improved convergence for Digital Globe cameras.
    * Added OpenCV-based SIFT and ORB interest point finding options.

 - point2dem, point2las, and pc_align
   * The datum (-r <planet> or --semi-major-axis) is optional now.
     The planet will be inferred automatically (together with the
     projection) from the input images if present. This can be useful
     for bodies that are not Moon, Mars, or Earth. The datum and
     projection can still be overridden with --reference-spheroid (or
     --datum) and --t_srs. 

 - dem_mosaic
   * Introduce --priority-blending-length, measured in input pixels. 
     If positive, keep unmodified values from the earliest available
     DEM at the current location except a band this wide near its
     boundary where blending will happen. Meant to be used with 
     smaller high-resolution "foreground" DEMs and larger
     lower-resolution "background" DEMs that should be specified later
     in the list. Changing --weights-exponent can improve transition.

 - pc_align
  * Added the ability to compute a manual rotation + translation +
    scale transform based on user-selected point correspondences
    from reference to source cloud in stereo_gui.

 - stereo_gui
   * Added the ability to generate ground control point (GCP) files
     for bundle_adjust by picking features. In addition to the images
     to be bundle-adjusted, one should provide a georeferenced image to find
     the GCP lon-lat, and a reference DEM to find the GCP heights.

Other

 - stereo
    * If the input images are map-projected (georeferenced) and 
      alignment method is none, all image outputs of stereo are
      georeferenced as well, such as GoodPixelMap, D_sub, disparity,
      etc. As such, all these data can be overlayed in stereo_gui.
    * The output point cloud saves datum info from input images
      (even when the inputs are not georeferenced). 
    * Increased reliability of interest point detection.
    * Decreased the default timeout to 900 seconds. This still needs
      tuning and a permanent solution is necessary.

 - point2dem, point2las, and pc_align
  * Accept --datum (-r) MOLA, as a shortcut for the sphere with
     radius 3,396,000 meters.

 - dem_mosaic
   * Fix an issue with minor jumps across tiles. 
   * Introduce --save-dem-weight <index>. Saves the weight image that
     tracks how much the input DEM with given index contributed to the
     output mosaic at each pixel (smallest index is 0).
   * Introduce --save-index-map. For each output pixel, save the
     index of the input DEM it came from (applicable only for
     --first, --last, --min, and --max). A text file with the index
     assigned to each input DEM is saved as well.
   * Rename --blending-length to --extra-crop-length, for clarity. 

 - dg_mosaic 
   * Added the switch --fix-seams to use interest point matching
     to fix seams in the output mosaic due to inconsistencies between
     image and camera data. Such artifacts may show up in older
     (2009 or earlier) Digital Globe images.

 - stereo_gui
   * Added the option --match-file to view interest point matches.
   * Added the options --delete-temporary-files-on-exit and
     --create-image-pyramids-only.
   * Can read the georeference of map-projected ISIS cubes.

 - point2dem
   * Respect --t_projwin to the letter. 
   * Can create simultaneously DEMs at multiple resolutions (by
     passing multiple values in quotes to --dem-spacing).
   * Fix minor discrepancies in the minor semi-axis for the WGS84,
     NAD83 and WGS72 datums. Now using GDAL/OGR for that.

 - point2las
   * Save the LAS file with a datum if the input PC had one.

 - image_calc
   * Fix calculation bug when no-data is present.

 - pc_align
  * Upgraded to the latest libpointmatcher. This may result in minor
    alignment changes as the core algorithm got modified.
  * Save all PC clouds with datum and projection info, if present. Add
    comment lines with the datum and projection to CSV files.

 - geodiff
   * Bugfix when the two DEMs have longitudes offset by 360 degrees.

 - colormap
   * Default style is binary-red-blue. Works better than jet when 
     data goes out of range.

 - pc_merge
   * Can merge clouds with 1 band. That is, can merge not only PC.tif
     files but also L.tif files, with the goal of using these two
     merged datasets to create a merged orthoimage with point2dem.

 - point2mesh
   * Can create a mesh from a DEM and an orthoimage (DRG file).

*** RELEASE 2.5.0, August 31, 2015 ***

-  Improved speed, coverage, and accuracy for areas with steep slopes
   for ISIS, RPC and Pinhole cameras by implementing stereo using
   images map-projected onto an existing DEM. This mapprojection is
   multi-process and hence much faster than cam2map. This
   functionality was previously available only for Digital Globe
   images.

 - New tools

    * Added stereo_gui, an image viewer and GUI front-end. Features:
      - View extremely large images using a pyramid approach.
      - If invoked with the same interface as stereo, can run stereo on 
        selected clips.
      - Load images with int, float, and RGB pixels, including ISIS
        cubes, DEMs, NTF, TIF, and other formats.
      - Can overlay georeferenced images and can toggle individual
        images on and off (like Google Earth).
      - Show images side-by-side, as tiles on grid, or on top of each other.
      - Create and view hillshaded DEMs.
      - View/add/delete interest points.
      - Create shadow thresholds by clicking on shadow pixels (needed
        for sfs).
      - Based on Michael Broxton's vwv tool. 

   * Added sfs, a tool to refine DEMs using shape-from-shading. Can
     optimize the DEM, albedo per pixel, image exposures and camera
     positions and orientations using a multi-resolution pyramid
     approach. Can handle shadows. Tested with LRO NAC lunar images at
     low latitudes and toward poles. It works only with ISIS images.
   * Added image_calc, a tool for performing simple per-pixel arithmetic
     operations on one or more images.
   * Added pc_merge, a tool for concatenating ASP-produced point clouds.
   * Added pansharp, a tool to apply a pansharp algorithm to a matched
     grayscale image and a low resolution color image.
   * Added datum_convert, a tool to transform a DEM to a different
     datum (e.g., NAD27 to WGS84).
   * Added geodiff, a tool for taking the (absolute) difference of two 
     DEMs.
   * Documented the colormap tool. Added a new colormap option based 
     on the paper "Diverging Color Maps for Scientific Visualization" 
     (http://www.sandia.gov/~kmorel/documents/ColorMaps/).
   * Added gdalinfo, gdal_translate, and gdalbuildvrt to the bin
     directory. These executables are compiled with JPEG2000 and
     BigTIFF support, and  can handle NTF images.

 - docs
   * Added a documentation section on 'tips and tricks', summarizing 
     in one place practices for getting the most out of ASP.

 - stereo
   * Increase the default correlation timeout to 1800 seconds.
   * Fix failure in interest point matching in certain circumstances.
   * Use bundle-adjusted models (if provided) at all stages of stereo,
     not just at triangulation.
   * Added --right-image-crop-win in addition to --left-image-crop-win.
     If both are specified, stereo crops both images to desired regions
     before running stereo (this is different from when only 
     --left-image-crop-win is specified, as then no actual cropping 
     happens, the domain of computation is just restricted to the desired
     area). 
   * Bugfix, remove outliers during search range determination.
   * Added the option --ip-per-tile, to search for more interest points 
     if the default is insufficient.
   * If the input images are georeferenced, the good pixel map will be
     written with a georeference.
 
 - point2dem
   * Fixed a slight discrepancy in the value of the semi-minor axis in
     the WGS84 and NAD83 datum implementations.
   * Added the option --median-filter-params <window size> <threshold> to
     remove spikes using a median filter.
   * Added the option --erode-length <num> to erode pixels from point cloud 
     boundary (after outliers are removed, but before filling in holes).
   * Improved hole-filling, and removed the --hole-fill-mode and 
     --hole-fill-num-smooth-iter, as there's only one algorithm now. 
   * Improved performance when large holes are to be filled.
   * Can create a DEM from point clouds stored in CSV files containing
     easting, northing, and height above datum (the PROJ.4 string
     needed to interpret these numbers should be set with --csv-proj4).
   * Fixed a bug in creating DEMs from CSV files when different projections
     are used on input and output.
   * Expose to user gnomonic and oblique stereographic projections,
     as well as false easting and false northing (where applicable). 
     This is a shortcut from using explicitly t_srs for the PROJ.4 string.
   * The default no-data value is set to the smallest float.
 
 - pc_align
   * Can ingest CSV files containing easting, northing, and height
     above datum (the PROJ.4 string needed to interpret these numbers
     should be set with --csv-proj4).
   * If the reference point cloud is a DEM, the initial and final errors
     in the statistics, as well as gross outlier removal, are done using
     a new distance function. Instead of finding the distance from a 3D 
     point to the closest point in the cloud, the 3D point is projected 
     onto DEM's datum, its longitude and latitude are found, the
     height in the DEM is interpolated, and and the obtained point on the 
     DEM is declared to be the closest point. This is more accurate
     than the original implementation for coarse DEMs. The old 
     approach is available using the --no-dem-distances flag.
   * Fix a bug with a 360 degree longitude offset.

 - point2las
   * Added the ability to specify a custom projection (PROJ.4 string)
     for output LAS files.

 - dem_mosaic
   * Write GeoTIFF files with blocks of size 256 x 256 as those
     may be faster to process with GDAL tools.
   * Bug fix when the tool is used to re-project.
   * Added the option --weights-blur-sigma <num> to allow the blending
     weights to be blurred by a Gaussian to increase their smoothness.
   * Added the option --weight-exponent <num>, to allow weights
     to increase faster than linearly.
   * Added --stddev option to compute standard deviation.
   * Added the ability to fill holes in the output mosaic.

 - bundle_adjust
    * Added new parameters, --ip-per-tile and --min-triangulation-angle.
    * Bug fix in handling situations when a point cannot get projected
      into the camera.
    * Bug fix in the camera adjustment logic. Any .adjust files may 
      need to be regenerated.

 - image2qtree
   * Bug fixes.
 
 - cam2map4stereo.py
   * Create temporary files in current directory, to avoid access
     issues to system directories.

 - mapproject
   * Can run on multiple machines.
   * Use multiple processes for ISIS images, for a huge speedup.
   * Bugfix, the mapprojected image should not go much beyond the DEM
     it is mapprojected onto (where it would have no valid pixels).

 - dg_mosaic
   * Default penalty weight produces a more accurate fit when creating an 
     RPC model from a DG model.
   * Handle the situation when two images to be mosaicked start at the 
     same output row number.
   * Added --target-resolution option to specify the output resolution in meters.

 - Misc.
   * Upgraded to ISIS 3.4.10.
   * Oldest supported OSX version is 10.8.
   * Added documentation for image2qtree and hillshade.

*** RELEASE 2.4.2, October 6, 2014 ***

 - ASP can perform multi-view triangulation (using both the
     stereo and parallel_stereo tools). The first image is set
     as reference, disparities are computed from it to the other 
     ones, and joint triangulation is performed.

 - Added a new tool, dem_mosaic, for mosaicking a large number of 
   DEMs, with erosion at boundary, smooth blending, and tiled output.
   Instead of blending, the tool can do the first, last, min, max,
   mean, median, or count of encountered DEM values.   

 - dg_mosaic
   * Support for multi-band (multi-spectral) images. Use --band <num>
     to pick a band to mosaic.
      
 - stereo
   * Bugfix in interest point matching in certain circumstances.
   * Set the correlation timeout to 600 seconds. This is generous
     and ensures runs don't stall. 
 
 - point2dem
   * Take as input n clouds and optionally n texture files, create a
     single DEM/orthoimage.
   * Take as input LAS and CSV files in addition to ASP's PC format.
   * Fix a bug in the interplay of hole-filling and outlier removal
     for orthoimage creation.
   * Ensure that the DEM grid is always at integer multiples of the
     grid size. This way, two DEMs with overlapping grids of the same
     size will be exactly on top of each other, minimizing interpolation
     error in subsequent mosaicking.
   * Outlier removal is on by default. Can be disabled by setting 
     the percentage in --remove-outliers-params to 100.
 
 - bundle_adjust
   * Use multiple-threads for non-ISIS sessions.
   * Added the parameter --overlap-limit <num> to limit the number 
     of subsequent images to search for matches to the current image.
   * Added the parameter --camera-weight <val>, to set the weight to
     give to the constraint that the camera positions/orientations
     stay close to the original values (only for the Ceres solver).

 - dem_geoid
   * Support the EGM2008 geoid. The geoid surface across all Earth
     is computed with an error of less than 1.5 cm compared to the
     values generated by harmonic synthesis. A 2.5 x 2.5 minute grid
     is used.
   * Converted the EGM geoids shipped with ASP to INT16 and JPEG2000,
     resulting in size reduction of more than 10x. 

 - wv_correct
    * Corrects TDI of 16, 48, 56, and 64 (forward and reverse scan
      directions) for WV01, TDI of 8 (forward only) for WV01, and TDI
      of 16, 48, 64 (forward and reverse scan directions) for
      WV02. Returns uncorrected images in other cases.

 - pc_align
    * Fix a crash for very large clouds.  
    * Use a progress bar when loading data.
    * Support LAS files on input and output.

 - point2las
    * Bugfix when saving LAS files in respect to a datum.

 - Documentation
    * Move the non-ISIS-specific tutorial sections onto its own
      chapter, to be read by both ISIS and Earth users. Updates and
      cleanup.

*** RELEASE 2.4.1, 12 July, 2014 ***

  - Added a new tool, bundle_adjust, which uses Google's ceres-solver
    to solve for adjusted camera positions and orientations. Works
    for n images and cameras, for all camera types supported by ASP. 

  - wv_correct
    * Improved corrections for WV01 images of TDI 16.

  - stereo_rfne
    * Performance bugfix when the integer disparity is noisy.
 
  - stereo_fltr
    * Fix for large memory usage when removing small islands from
      disparity with --erode-max-size.

  - stereo_tri
    * Bugfixes for MER cameras.

  - stereo_tri and mapproject
    * Added the option --bundle-adjust-prefix to read adjusted
      camera models obtained by previously running bundle_adjust with
      this output prefix.

  - point2las
    * LAS files can be saved in geo-referenced format in respect 
      to a specified datum (option --reference-spheroid).
 
  - point2dem
    * Bugfix, longitude could be off by 360 degrees.
    * Robustness to large jumps in point cloud values.

  - pc_align
    * Ability to read and write CSV files having UTM data (easting,
      northing, height above datum).
    * Read DEMs in the ISIS cube format.

*** RELEASE 2.4.0, 28 April, 2014 ***

  - Added wv_correct, a tool for correcting artifacts in Digital Globe
    WorldView-1 and WorldView-2 images with TDI of 16.
  - Added logging to a file for stereo, pc_align, point2dem, 
    point2mesh, point2las, and dem_geoid.
  - Added a tutorial for processing Digital Globe Earth imagery
    and expanded the MOC tutorial.
  - Bug fixes in mosaicking of Digital Globe images.

  - parallel_stereo
     * Use dynamic load balancing for improved performance.
     * Automatically determine the optimal number of processes
       and threads for each stage of stereo.

  - stereo_pprc
     * Added the --skip-image-normalization option (for non-ISIS 
       images and alignment-method none), it can help with reducing
       the size of data on disk and performance.
       
  - stereo_rfne
     * Added new affine subpixel refinement mode when 
       --subpixel-mode = 3. This mode sacrifices the error resistance
       of Bayes EM mode in exchange for reduced computation time.
       For some data sets this can perform as well as Bayes EM in
       about one fifth the time.

  - stereo_fltr:
     * Hole-filling is disabled by default in stereo_fltr. It is 
       suggested to use instead point2dem's analogous functionality.
       It can be re-enabled using --enable-fill-holes.
     * Added the option --erode-max-size to remove isolated blobs.
     * Relaxed filtering of disparities, retaining more valid
       disparities. Can be adjusted with --filter-mode and related
       parameters.

  - stereo_tri:
    * Added ability to save triangulation error for a DEM as a 3D
      North-East-Down vector rather than just its magnitude.
    * When acting on map-projected images, handle the case when the 
      DEM used for map-projection does not completely encompass the 
      images.
 
  - pc_align:
    * Read and write CSV files in a wide variety of formats, using 
      the --csv-format option.
    * Display the translation component of the rigid alignment
      transform in the local North-East-Down coordinate system, as
      well as the centroid of source points used in alignment.
    * Save to disk the convergence history (iteration information).
    * Added the ability to explicitly specify the datum semi-axes.
    * Bug fix for saving transformed clouds for Moon and Mars.
    * More efficient processing of reference and source points
      by loading only points in each cloud within a neighborhood
      of the long/lat bounding box of the other cloud.
    * Make it possible to generate ortho and error images using
      point2dem with the transformed clouds output by pc_align.

  - point2dem:
     * Replaced the core algorithm. Instead of sampling the point
       cloud surface, which is prone to aliasing, the DEM height at a
       given grid point is obtained as a weighted average of heights
       of all points in the cloud within search radius of the grid
       point, with the weights given by a Gaussian. The cutoff of the
       Gaussian can be controlled using the --search-radius-factor
       option. The old algorithm is still available (but obsoleted)
       using the --use-surface-sampling option. The new algorithm
       makes the --fsaa option redundant. 
     * Added the ability to remove outliers by triangulation error,
       either automatically (--remove-outliers) or manually, with 
       given error threshold (--max-valid-triangulation-error).
     * Added two algorithms to fill holes in the output DEM and 
       orthoimage (--hole-fill-mode).
     * The way the default DEM spacing is computed was modified, 
       to make dependent only on the local distribution of points
       in the cloud and robust to outliers. 
     * Can handle highly noisy input point clouds without spikes in 
       memory usage and processing time.
     * Improved memory usage and performance for large point clouds.
     * Bug fix, the DEM was shifted by 1 pixel from true location.

*** RELEASE 2.3.0, 19 November, 2013 ***

TOOLS

  - Added pc_align, a tool for aligning point clouds, using the
    libpointmacher library
    (https://github.com/ethz-asl/libpointmatcher). Sparse and dense
    point clouds are supported, as well as DEMs. Two ICP methods are
    supported, point-to-plane and point-to-point. Memory and processing
    usage are proportional to the desired number of input points
    to use rather than to the overall input data sizes.

  - Added lronac2mosaic.py, a tool for merging the LE and RE images
    from the LRONAC camera into a single map-projected image.  The
    output images can be fed into the stereo tool to generate DEMs.
  
  - rpc_maprpoject and orthoproject are combined into a single tool
    for projecting a camera image onto a DEM for any camera model
    supported by Stereo Pipeline. The old orthoproject is kept for 
    backward compatibility for a while.

GENERAL 


  - Stereo Pipeline (almost) daily and fully verified builds for all
    platforms are available for the adventurous user
    (http://byss.arc.nasa.gov/stereopipeline/daily_build/). When
    requesting support, please provide the output of "stereo --version".

  - The size of Stereo Pipeline output data has been reduced, by up to
    40%, particularly point clouds and DEMs are between 30% to 70%
    smaller.  Better encoding is used, output data is rounded (up to 1
    mm), and point clouds are offset and saved as float instead of
    double.
    
  - Timeout option added for stereo correlation, preventing
    unreasonably long correlation times for certain image tiles.

  - Subpixel mosaicking in dg_mosaic uses bilinear interpolation
    instead of nearest neighbor avoiding artifacts in certain
    situations.

  - dg_mosaic can generate a combined RPC model in addition to the
    combined DG model. It accepts flags for specifying input and 
    output nodata values.

  - point2dem with the --fsaa option for reducing aliasing at
    low-resolution DEM generation has been improved as to remove the
    erosion of of valid data close to no-data values.

  - Bugfixes for parallel_stereo, point2dem, etc.
