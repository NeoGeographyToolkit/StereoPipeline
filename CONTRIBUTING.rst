Contributing
============

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every
little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute to ASP in many ways:

Types of Contributions
----------------------

Report Bugs or Ask for Features via Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We want to hear from you!  You can report bugs, ask for new features,
or just raise issues or concerns via logging an `Issue via our
GitHub repo <https://github.com/NeoGeographyToolkit/StereoPipeline/issues>`_.


Fix Bugs or Implement Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Look through the GitHub Issues for bugs to fix or feautures to implement.
If anything looks tractable to you, work on it.  Most (if not all) PRs should
be based on an Issue, so if you're thinking about doing some coding on a topic
that isn't covered in an Issue, please author one so you can get some feedback
while you work on your PR.

Write Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ASP could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official docs, on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.

Submit Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to send feedback is to file an `Issue
<https://github.com/NeoGeographyToolkit/StereoPipeline/issues>`_.


Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? 

You'll need to follow the instructions for building ASP from source 
(which can be found in the INSTALLGUIDE.rst file or the Installation
chapter of the documentation).


1. Fork the `StereoPipeline` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/StereoPipeline.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtual environment like virtualenv
   or conda, if needed.

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass a run
   of `make gtest_all`

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a `pull request <https://github.com/NeoGeographyToolkit/StereoPipeline/pulls>`_.


Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. 
   Add the feature to the list in NEWS.rst and potentially update the README.rst 
   or other documentation files.


What to expect
--------------

Our development of ASP is neither continuous, nor as well-funded
as we might like, and it is entirely possible that when you submit
a PR, none of us will have the time to evaluate or integrate your
PR.  If we don't, we'll try and communicate that with you via the
PR.

For large conributions, it is likely that you, or your employer,
will be retaining your copyrights, but releasing the contributions
via an open-source license.  It must be compatible with the Apache-2
license that ASP is distributed with, so that we can redistribute
that contribution with ASP, give you credit, and make ASP even
better!  Please contact us if you have a contribution of that nature, 
so we can be sure to get all of the details right.

For smaller contributions, where you (or your employer) are not
concerned about retaining copyright (but we will give you credit!),
you will need to fill out a Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
if we plan to accept your PR.  The CLA assigns your copyright in
your contribution to NASA, so that our NASA copyright statement
remains true:

    Copyright (c) YEAR, United States Government as represented by the 
    Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
    All rights reserved.

There is an `Individual CLA <https://github.com/NeoGeographyToolkit/StereoPipeline/blob/master/docs/ASP_Individual_CLA.doc>`_ (`PDF
Version <https://github.com/NeoGeographyToolkit/StereoPipeline/blob/master/docs/ASP_Individual_CLA.pdf>`_) and a `Corporate CLA
<https://github.com/NeoGeographyToolkit/StereoPipeline/blob/master/docs/ASP_Corporate_CLA.doc>`_.
