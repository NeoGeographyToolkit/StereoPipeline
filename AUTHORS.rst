The Ames Stereo Pipeline (ASP) was originally developed by the
Intelligent Robotics Group (IRG), in the Intelligent Systems Division
at the NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, CA.

The open source Stereo Pipeline leverages stereo image processing
work, led by Michael J. Broxton (NASA/CMU), Dr. Laurence Edwards
(NASA), Eric Zbinden (formerly NASA/QSS Inc.), Dr. Michael Sims
(NASA), and others in the Intelligent Systems Division at NASA Ames
Research Center. It has benefited substantially from the contributions
of Dr. Keith Nishihara (formerly NASA/Stanford), Randy Sargent
(NASA/Carnegie Mellon University), Dr. Judd Bowman (formerly NASA/QSS
Inc.), Clay Kunz (formerly NASA/QSS Inc.), and Dr. Matthew Deans
(NASA).

The initial adaptation of Ames's stereo surface reconstruction tools to
orbital imagers was a result of a NASA funded, industry led project to
develop automated DEM generation techniques for the MGS mission. Our
work with that project's Principal Investigator, Dr. Michael Malin of
Malin Space Science Systems (MSSS), and Co-Investigator, Dr. Laurence
Edwards of NASA Ames, inspired the idea of making stereo surface
reconstruction technology available and accessible to a broader
community. We thank Dr. Malin and Dr. Edwards for providing the initial
impetus that in no small way made this open source stereo pipeline
possible, and we thank Dr. Michael Caplinger, Joe Fahle and others at
MSSS for their help and technical assistance.

The tools for rig calibration (:numref:`rig_calibrator`), fusion of
points clouds into meshes (:numref:`multi_stereo`), and texturing of
meshes (:numref:`texrecon`), were originally developed as part of the
NASA ISAAC project, with Trey Smith as project manager, and rely
heavily on third-party packages, including Theia SfM, Ceres Solver,
VoxBlox, and MVS Texturing.

We'd also like to thank our friends and collaborators Dr. Randolph
Kirk, Dr. Brent Archinal, Trent Hare, Mark Rosiek, and David Mayer
of the United States Geological Survey's (USGS's) Astrogeology
Science Center in Flagstaff, AZ, for their encouragement and
willingness to share their experience and expertise by answering
many of our technical questions. We also thank them for their ongoing
support and efforts to help us evaluate our work. Thanks also to
the USGS ISIS team, especially Jeff Anderson, Kris Becker, Jay
Laura, and Jesse Mapel, for their help in integrating stereo pipeline
with the USGS ISIS software package.

Thanks go also to Dr. Mark Robinson, Jacob Danton, Ernest
Bowman-Cisneros, Dr. Sam Laurence, and Melissa Bunte at Arizona
State University for their help in adapting the Ames Stereo Pipeline
to lunar data sets including the Apollo Metric Camera.

We'd also like to thank Dr. David Shean, Dr. Ben Smith, and Dr. Ian
Joughin of the Applied Physics Laboratory at the University of
Washington for providing design direction for adapting Ames Stereo
Pipeline to Earth sciences.

Finally, we thank Dr. Ara Nefian, and Dr. Laurence Edwards for their
contributions to this software, and Dr. Terry Fong (IRG Group Lead
during the first decade or so of ASP's existence) for his management
and support of the open source and public software release process.
