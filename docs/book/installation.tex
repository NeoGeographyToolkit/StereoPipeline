\chapter{Installation}

\section{Binary Installation}

This is the recommended method. Only the Stereo Pipeline binaries are
required. ISIS is required only for users who wish to process
NASA non-terrestrial imagery.

\begin{description}
\item [{Stereo~Pipeline~Tarball.}] The main Stereo Pipeline page is \\
\url{http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/asr/intelligent-robotics/ngt/stereo/}.
Download the \emph{Binary} option that matches the platform you wish
to use. The recommend but optional \ac{ISIS} version is listed next to
the name; choose the newest version you have available.

\item [{USGS~ISIS~Binary~Distribution.}]

The Stereo Pipeline optionally depends on \ac{ISIS} version 3 from the
\ac{USGS}\@. It is required for anyone who is processing camera data
from ISIS supported missions such as HiRISE, LRO-NAC, MGS, and most
other NASA satellites. Their installation guide is at
\url{http://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/documents/InstallGuide}. You
must use their binaries as-is; if you need to recompile, you must
follow the \emph{Source Installation} guide for the Stereo Pipeline in
Section~\ref{sec:Source-Installation}.  Note also that the \ac{USGS}
provides only the current version of \ac{ISIS} and the previous
version (denoted with a `\texttt{\_OLD}' suffix) via their
\texttt{rsync} service.  If the current version is newer than the
version of ISIS that the Stereo Pipeline is compiled against, be
assured that we're working on rolling out a new version.  In the
meantime, you should be able to sync the previous version of ISIS
which should work with Stereo Pipeline.  To do so, view the listing of
modules that is provided via the `\texttt{rsync
  isisdist.wr.usgs.gov::}' command.  You should see several modules
listed with the `\texttt{\_OLD}' suffix.  Select the one that is
appropriate for your system, and \texttt{rsync} according to the
instructions.

The Stereo Pipeline will be able to work with newer versions of ISIS
than it was built against as long as the ISIS cube format hasn't
changed. We ship a copy of the ISIS libraries that we built
against. Running our executables only requires that you have
downloaded the ISIS secondary data and have appropriately set the
\texttt{ISIS3DATA} enviromental variable. This is normally performed
for the user by ISIS's startup script,
\texttt{\$ISISROOT/scripts/isis3Startup.sh}.

\end{description}

\subsection{Quick Start for Digital Globe users}
\begin{description}

\item[{Fetch~Stereo~Pipeline}] ~\\
Download the Stereo Pipeline from \url{http://irg.arc.nasa.gov/ngt/stereo}.

\item[{Untar~Stereo~Pipeline}] ~\\
\texttt{tar xvfz StereoPipeline-\textit{VERSION-ARCH-OS}.tar.gz}

\item [{Try~It~Out!}] ~\\

Documentation hasn't been finished at this point in time yet. However
your imagery needs to be converted to the GeoTIFF format before ASP
can read it. ASP doesn't have native support for NITF that uses an
underlining JPEG2000 compression.

Once converted the, the command line arguments to \texttt{stereo} look
like the following: ~\\
\texttt{stereo \textit{LEFT IMAGE} \textit{RIGHT IMAGE} \textit{LEFT XML} \textit{RIGHT XML} \textit{OUTPUT PREFIX}}

The settings discussed the next chapter (Chapter~\ref{ch:tutorial})
apply to Digital Globe sessions as well. However the example requires
ISIS to be installed inorder to run. This may or may not be worth your
time to install.
\end{description}

\subsection{Common Traps}

Here are some errors you might see, and what it could mean. Treat
these as templates for problems--in practice, the error messages might
be slightly different.

\begin{verbatim}
**I/O ERROR** Unable to open [$ISIS3DATA/Some/Path/Here].
Stereo step 0: Preprocessing failed
\end{verbatim}

You need to set up your ISIS environment or manually set the correct location for \texttt{ISIS3DATA}.

\begin{verbatim}
point2mesh E0201461-M0100115-PC.tif E0201461-M0100115-L.tif
[...]
99%  Vertices:   [************************************************************] Complete!

zsh: bus error  point2mesh E0201461-M0100115-PC.tif E0201461-M0100115-L.tif
\end{verbatim}

The source of this problem is an old version of OpenSceneGraph in
your library path. Check your \verb#LD_LIBRARY_PATH# (for Linux),
\verb#DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH# (for OSX), or your \verb#DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH#
(for OSX) to see if you have an old version listed, and remove it
from the path if that is the case. It is not necessary to remove the
old versions from your computer, you just need to remove the reference
to them from your library path.

\section{\label{sec:Source-Installation}Source Installation}

This method is for advanced users with moderate build system experience. Some dependencies such as ISIS and its dependencies \emph{(like SuperLU, Qwt, CSpice)} use custom build systems. Because of this and time, we won't help with questions on how to build dependencies.

\subsection{Dependency List}

This is a list of the direct dependencies of Stereo Pipeline. Some libraries
(like \ac{ISIS}) have dependencies of their own which are not covered here.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=5in]{graph/asp_deps.pdf}
  \caption{Graph outlining some dependencies. Not all of ISIS's are shown.}
\end{figure}

\begin{description}
\item [{Boost}] (Required) \url{http://www.boost.org/}\\
Version 1.35 or greater is required. Along with the base library
set, the Stereo Pipeline specifically requires: Program Options, Filesystem,
Thread, and Graph.

\item [{LAPACK}] (Required)\\
There are many sources for LAPACK\@. For OSX, you can use the
vecLib framework. For Linux, you can use the netlib LAPACK/CLAPACK
distributions, or Intel's MKL, or any of a number of others. The math
is unfortunately not a hotspot in the code, though, so using a faster
LAPACK implementation will not change much. Therefore, you should
probably just use the LAPACK your package manager (RPM for Red Hat
Linux, Yast for SuSE, etc.) has available.

\item [{ISIS}] (Recommended) \url{http://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/documents/InstallGuide}\\

The \ac{USGS} \acf{ISIS} library. This library handles the camera
models and image formats used for instruments.  \ac{ISIS} is usually
downloaded and used as a binary distribution.  Compilation of
\ac{ISIS} from source can be challenging, and their support forums may
provide assistance:
\url{https://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/IsisSupport/}. Cleaning and
modification of their source code maybe required if you would like to
use a newer version of ISIS's dependencies that may be available already
by your system.

Because of the extreme difficulty of building ISIS (since most
problems will needed be sorted out by the user themselves), it is not
recommended that users try to build ISIS themselves. This leaves users
the only option of using ISIS and ASP binaries that are available
online.

\item [{OpenSceneGraph}] (Optional) \url{http://www.openscenegraph.org/}\\

OpenSceneGraph is required to run the \texttt{point2mesh} tool (See
Section~\ref{point2mesh}). This library provides a convenient way of
building OpenGL graphics through the method of scene graphs. It also
provides a file format and utilities for display these scene
graphs. The output file of \texttt{point2mesh} is an OpenSceneGraph
binary scene graph format.

\item [{GDAL}] (Optional) \url{http://www.gdal.org}\\

GDAL handles most of the File IO for Ames Stereo Pipeline. It also
provides the support the ingestion of proj4 strings from the
user. This is required if you wish to support the BigTIFF format and
write files larger that 4GB.

\item [{Vision~Workbench}] (Required) \url{http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/visionworkbench/}\\

Vision Workbench forms much of the core processing code of the Stereo
Pipeline. Vision Workbench contains almost all of the image processing
algorithms, such as image filters, image arithmetic, stereo
correlation, and triangulation. This means that Stereo Pipeline is
just a collection of applications that implement Vision Workbench in
the context of ISIS.

\item [{Python 2.4+}] (Required) \url{http://www.python.org}\\

Some applications of Stereo Pipeline are actually python scripts.

\end{description}

\subsection{Build System}

The build system is built on GNU autotools. In-depth information on
autotools is available from \url{http://sources.redhat.com/autobook/}.
The basics, however, are simple. To compile the source code, first
run~\verb#./configure# from the top-level directory. This will search
for the dependencies and enable the modules you requested. There are
a number of options that can be passed to \verb#configure#; many
of these options can also be placed into a \verb#config.options#
file (in the form of \verb#VARIABLE="VALUE"#) in the same directory
as \verb#configure#. Table \ref{tab:Supported-configure-options}
lists the supported options.

\section{\label{sec:Settings}Settings Optimization}

Finally the last thing to be done for Stereo Pipeline is to setup up
Vision Workbench's render settings. This step is optional, but for
best performance some thought should be applied here.

Vision Workbench is a multithreaded image processing library used by
Stero Pipeline. The settings by which Vision Workbench processes is
configurable by having a \texttt{~/.vwrc} file hidden in your home
directory. Below is an example of one used on a Mac Pro workstation.

\begin{minipage}{0.94\linewidth}
\small\listinginput{1}{LogConf.example}
\end{minipage}

There are a lot of possible options that can be implemented in the
above example. Let's cover the most important options and the concerns
the user should have when selecting a value.

\pagebreak
\begin{description}

\item[default\_num\_threads \textnormal (default=2)] \hfill \\

This sets the maximium number of threads that can being used for
rendering. When stereo's \texttt{subpixel\_rfne} is running you'll
probably notice 10 threads are running when you have
\texttt{default\_num\_threads} set to 8. This is not an error, you are
seeing 8 threads be used for rendering, 1 thread for holding
\texttt{main()}'s execution, and finally 1 optional thread acting as the
interface to the file driver.

It is usually best to set this parameter equal to the number of
processors on your systems. Be sure to include the number of logical
processors in your arithmetic if your system supports hyper-threading.

Adding more threads for rasterization increases the memory demands of
Stereo Pipeline. If your system is memory limited, it might be best to
lower the \texttt{default\_num\_threads} option. Remember that 32 bit
systems can only allocate 4 GB of memory per process. Despite Stereo
Pipeline being a multithreaded application, it is still a single
process.

\item[write\_pool\_size \textnormal (default=21)] \hfill \\

The \texttt{write\_pool\_size} option represents the max waiting pool
size of tiles waiting to be written to disk. Most file formats do not
allow tiles to be written arbitrarily out of order. Most however will
let rows of tiles to be written out of order, while tiles inside a row
must be written in order. Because of the previous constraint, after a
tile is rasterized it might spend  some time waiting in the 'write
pool' before it can be written to disk. If the 'write pool' fills up,
only the next tile in order can be rasterized. That makes Stereo
Pipeline perform like it is only using a single processor.

Increasing the \texttt{write\_pool\_size} makes Stereo Pipeline more
able to use all processing cores in the system. Having this value too
large can mean excessive use of memory. For 32 bit systems again, they
can run out of memory if this value is too high for the same reason as
described for \texttt{default\_num\_threads}.

\item[system\_cache\_size \textnormal (default=805306368)] \hfill \\

Accessing a file from hard drive can be very slow. It is especially
bad if an application needs to make multiple passes over an input
file. To increase performance, Vision Workbench will usually leave an
input file stored in memory for quick access. This file storage is
known as the 'system cache' and its max size is dictated by
\texttt{system\_cache\_size}. The default value is 768 MB.

Setting this value too high can cause your application to crash. It is
usually recommend to keep this value around 1/4 of the maximum
available memory on the system. For 32 bit systems, this means don't
set this value any greater than 1 GB. The units of this property is in bytes.

\item[0 = *.progress] \hfill \\

This line is not assigning a value to progress, it is however setting
the logging level of progress bars. In the above example, this
statement is made under the \texttt{[logfile console]} state. This
means that only progress bars of type \texttt{ErrorMessage} will ever
be printed to the console. If you wanted progress bars up to type \texttt{InfoMessage}, then the line in log file should be changed to:

\begin{verbatim}
    [logfile console]
    20 = *.progress
\end{verbatim}

\end{description}
