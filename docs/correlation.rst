Stereo Correlation
==================

In this chapter we will dive much deeper into understanding the core
algorithms in the Stereo Pipeline. We start with an overview of the five
stages of stereo reconstruction. Then we move into an in-depth
discussion and exposition of the various correlation algorithms.

The goal of this chapter is to build an intuition for the stereo
correlation process. This will help users to identify unusual results in
their DEMs and hopefully eliminate them by tuning various parameters in
the ``stereo.default`` file (:numref:`stereodefault`). For scientists and
engineers who are using DEMs produced with the Stereo Pipeline, this
chapter may help to answer the question, “What is the Stereo Pipeline
doing to the raw data to produce this DEM?”

A related question that is commonly asked is, “How accurate is a DEM
produced by the Stereo Pipeline?” This chapter does not yet address
matters of accuracy and error, however we have several efforts underway
to quantify the accuracy of Stereo Pipeline-derived DEMs, and will be
publishing more information about that shortly. Stay tuned.

The entire stereo correlation process, from raw input images to a point
cloud or DEM, can be viewed as a multistage pipeline as depicted in
:numref:`asp`, and detailed in the following sections.

   Flow of data through the Stereo Pipeline.

Pre-Processing
--------------

The first optional (but recommended) step in the process is least
squares Bundle Adjustment, which is described in detail in
:numref:`bundle_adjustment`.

Next, the left and right images are roughly aligned using one of
the four methods: (1) a homography transform of the right image
based on automated tie-point measurements, (2) an affine epipolar
transform of both the left and right images (also based on tie-point
measurements as earlier), the effect of which is equivalent to
rotating the original cameras which took the pictures, (3) a 3D
rotation that achieves epipolar rectification (only implemented for
Pinhole sessions for missions like MER or K10 – see
:numref:`mer-example` and :numref:`k10example`) or (4)
map-projection of both the left and right images using the ISIS
``cam2map`` command or through the more general ``mapproject`` tool
that works for any cameras supported by ASP (see :numref:`mapproj-example`
for the latter). The first three options can be applied automatically
by the Stereo Pipeline when the ``alignment-method`` variable in
the ``stereo.default`` file is set to ``affineepipolar``, ``homography``,
or ``epipolar``, respectively.

The latter option, running ``cam2map``, ``cam2map4stereo.py``, or
``mapproject`` must be carried out by the user prior to invoking the
``stereo`` command. Map-projecting the images using ISIS eliminates any
unusual distortion in the image due to the unusual camera acquisition
modes (e.g. pitching “ROTO” maneuvers during image acquisition for MOC,
or highly elliptical orbits and changing line exposure times for the ,
HRSC). It also eliminates some of the perspective differences in the
image pair that are due to large terrain features by taking the existing
low-resolution terrain model into account (e.g. the :term:`MOLA`, :term:`LOLA`,
:term:`NED`, or :term:`ULCN` 2005 models).

In essence, map-projecting the images results in a pair of very closely
matched images that are as close to ideal as possible given existing
information. This leaves only small perspective differences in the
images, which are exactly the features that the stereo correlation
process is designed to detect.

For this reason, we recommend map-projection for pre-alignment of most
stereo pairs. Its only cost is longer triangulation times as more math
must be applied to work back through the transforms applied to the
images. In either case, the pre-alignment step is essential for
performance because it ensures that the disparity search space is
bounded to a known area. In both cases, the effects of pre-alignment are
taken into account later in the process during triangulation, so you do
not need to worry that pre-alignment will compromise the geometric
integrity of your DEM.

In some cases the pre-processing step may also normalize the pixel
values in the left and right images to bring them into the same
dynamic range. Various options in the ``stereo.default`` file affect
whether or how normalization is carried out, including
``individually-normalize`` and ``force-use-entire-range``. Although
the defaults work in most cases, the use of these normalization
steps can vary from data set to data set, so we recommend you refer
to the examples in :numref:`examples` to see if these are necessary
in your use case.

Finally, pre-processing can perform some filtering of the input
images (as determined by ``prefilter-mode``) to reduce noise and
extract edges in the images.  When active, these filters apply a
kernel with a sigma of ``prefilter-kernel-width`` pixels that can
improve results for noisy images (``prefilter-mode`` must be chosen
carefully in conjunction with ``cost-mode``, see :numref:`stereodefault`).
The pre-processing modes that extract image edges are useful for
stereo pairs that do not have the same lighting conditions, contrast,
and absolute brightness :cite:`Nishihara84practical`. We recommend
that you use the defaults for these parameters to start with, and
then experiment only if your results are sub-optimal.

.. _d-sub:

Disparity Map Initialization
----------------------------

Correlation is the process at the heart of the Stereo Pipeline. It is a
collection of algorithms that compute correspondences between pixels in
the left image and pixels in the right image. The map of these
correspondences is called a *disparity map*. You can think of a
disparity map as an image whose pixel locations correspond to the pixel
:math:`(u,v)` in the left image, and whose pixel values contain the
horizontal and vertical offsets :math:`(d_u, d_v)` to the matching pixel
in the right image, which is :math:`(u+d_u, v+d_v)`.

The correlation process attempts to find a match for every pixel in the
left image. The only pixels skipped are those marked invalid in the mask
images. For large images (e.g. from HiRISE, , LROC, or WorldView), this
is very expensive computationally, so the correlation process is split
into two stages. The disparity map initialization step computes
approximate correspondences using a pyramid-based search that is highly
optimized for speed, but trades resolution for speed. The results of
disparity map initialization are integer-valued disparity estimates. The
sub-pixel refinement step takes these integer estimates as initial
conditions for an iterative optimization and refines them using the
algorithm discussed in the next section.

We employ several optimizations to accelerate disparity map
initialization: (1) a box filter-like accumulator that reduces duplicate
operations during correlation :cite:`Sun02rectangular`; (2)
a coarse-to-fine pyramid based approach where disparities are estimated
using low-resolution images, and then successively refined at higher
resolutions; and (3) partitioning of the disparity search space into
rectangular sub-regions with similar values of disparity determined in
the previous lower resolution level of the pyramid
:cite:`Sun02rectangular`.

.. figure:: images/correlation/correlation_400px.png
   :name: correlation_window
   :alt: Visal Correlation example

   The correlation algorithm in disparity map initialization uses a
   sliding template window from the left image to find the best match in
   the right image. The size of the template window can be adjusted
   using the ``H_KERN`` and ``V_KERN`` parameters in the
   ``stereo.default`` file, and the search range can be adjusted using
   the ``{H,V}_CORR_{MIN/MAX}`` parameters.

Naive correlation itself is carried out by moving a small, rectangular
template window from the from left image over the specified search
region of the right image, as in :numref:`correlation_window`. The
“best” match is determined by applying a cost function that compares the
two windows. The location at which the window evaluates to the lowest
cost compared to all the other search locations is reported as the
disparity value. The ``cost-mode`` variable allows you to choose one of
three cost functions, though we recommend normalized cross correlation
:cite:`Menard97:robust`, since it is most robust to slight
lighting and contrast variations between a pair of images. Try the
others if you need more speed at the cost of quality.

Our implementation of pyramid correlation is a little unique in that it
is actually split into two levels of pyramid searching. There is a
``output_prefix-D_sub.tif`` disparity image that is computed from the
greatly reduced input images ``*-L_sub.tif`` and
``output_prefix-R_sub.tif``. Those “sub” images have their size chosen
so that their area is around 2.25 megapixels, a size that is easily
viewed on the screen unlike the raw source images. The low-resolution
disparity image then defines the per thread search range of the higher
resolution disparity, ``output_prefix-D.tif``.

This solution is imperfect but comes from our model of multi-threaded
processing. ASP processes individual tiles of the output disparity in
parallel. The smaller the tiles, the easier it is to distribute evenly
among the CPU cores. The size of the tile unfortunately limits the max
number of pyramid levels we can process. We’ve struck a balance where
every 1024 by 1024 pixel area is processed individually in a tile. This
practice allows only 5 levels of pyramid processing. With the addition
of the second tier of pyramid searching with
``output_prefix-D_sub.tif``, we are allowed to process beyond that
limitation.

Any large failure in the low-resolution disparity image will be
detrimental to the performance of the higher resolution disparity.
In the event that the low-resolution disparity is completely
unhelpful, it can be skipped by adding ``corr-seed-mode 0`` in the
``stereo.default`` file and using a manual search range
(:numref:`search_range`). This should only be considered in cases
where the texture in an image is completely lost when subsampled.
An example would be satellite images of fresh snow in the Arctic.
Alternatively, ``output_prefix-D_sub.tif`` can be computed at a
sparse set of pixels at full resolution, as described in :numref:`sparse-disp`.

An alternative to computing ``output_prefix-D.tif`` from sub-sampled
images (``corr-seed-mode 1``) or skipping it altogether
(``corr-seed-mode 0``), is to compute it from a lower-resolution DEM of
the area (``corr-seed-mode 2``). In this situation, the low-resolution
DEM needs to be specified together with its estimated error. See 
:numref:`corr_section` for more detailed information as to
how to specify these options. In our experiments, if the input DEM has a
resolution of 1 km, a good value for the DEM error is about 10 m, or
higher if the terrain is very variable.

Debugging Disparity Map Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Never will all pixels be successfully matched during stereo matching.
Though a good chunk of the image should be correctly processed. If you
see large areas where matching failed, this could be due to a variety of
reasons:

-  In regions where the images do not overlap, there should be no valid
   matches in the disparity map.

-  Match quality may be poor in regions of the images that have
   different lighting conditions, contrast, or specular properties of
   the surface.

-  Areas that have image content with very little texture or extremely
   low contrast may have an insufficient signal to noise ratio, and will
   be rejected by the correlator.

-  Areas that are highly distorted due to different image perspective,
   such as crater and canyon walls, may exhibit poor matching
   performance. This could also be due to failure of the preprocessing
   step in aligning the images. The correlator can not match images that
   are rotated differently from each other or have different
   scale/resolution. Mapprojection is used to at least partially rectify
   these issues (:numref:`mapproj-example`).

Bad matches, often called “blunders” or “artifacts” are also common, and
can happen for many of the same reasons listed above. The Stereo
Pipeline does its best to automatically detect and eliminate these
blunders, but the effectiveness of these outlier rejection strategies
does vary depending on the quality of the input images.

When tuning up your ``stereo.default`` file, you will find that it is
very helpful to look at the raw output of the disparity map
initialization step. This can be done using the ``disparitydebug`` tool,
which converts the ``output_prefix-D.tif`` file into a pair of normal
images that contain the horizontal and vertical components of disparity.
You can open these in a standard image viewing application and see
immediately which pixels were matched successfully, and which were not.
Stereo matching blunders are usually also obvious when inspecting these
images. With a good intuition for the effects of various
``stereo.default`` parameters and a good intuition for reading the
output of ``disparitydebug``, it is possible to quickly identify and
address most problems.

If you are seeing too many holes in your disparity images, one option
that may give good results is to increase the size of the correlation
kernel used by ``stereo_corr`` with the ``–corr-kernel`` option.
Increasing the kernel size will increase the processing time but should
help fill in regions of the image where no match was found.

.. figure:: images/correlation/stereo_corr_box_compare.png
   :name: corr-kernel-size-effect
   :alt: Correlation Kernel Size

   The effect of increasing the correlation kernel size from 35 (left)
   to 75 (right). This location is covered in snow and several regions
   lack texture for the correlator to use but a large kernel increases
   the chances of finding useful texture for a given pixel.

.. figure:: images/correlation/quantile_filter_result.png
   :name: quantile-filtering-effect
   :alt: Quantile Filtering

   The effect of using the ``rm-quantile`` filtering option in
   ``stereo_corr``. In the left image there are a series of high
   disparity "islands" at the bottom of the image. In the right image
   quantile filtering has removed those islands while leaving the rest
   of the image intact.

.. _search_range:

Search Range Determination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some circumstances, the low-resolution disparity ``D_sub.tif`` may
fail to get computed, or it may be inaccurate. This can happen for
example if only very small features are present in the original images,
and they disappear during the resampling that is necessary to obtain
``D_sub.tif``. In this case, it is possible to set ``corr-seed-mode`` to
0, and manually set a search range to use for full-resolution
correlation via the parameter ``corr-search``. In ``stereo.default``
this parameter’s entry will look like::

           corr-search -80 -2 20 2

The exact values to use with this option you’ll have to discover
yourself. The numbers right of ``corr-search`` represent the horizontal
minimum boundary, vertical minimum boundary, horizontal maximum
boundary, and finally the horizontal maximum boundary within which we
will search for the disparity during correlation.

It can be tricky to select a good search range for the
``stereo.default`` file. That’s why the best way is to let ``stereo``
perform an automated guess for the search range. If you find that you
can do a better estimate of the search range, take look at the
intermediate disparity images using the ``disparitydebug`` program to
figure out which search directions can be expanded or contracted. The
output images will clearly show good data or bad data depending on
whether the search range is correct.

The worst case scenario is to determine the search range manually. For
example, for ISIS images, both images could be opened in ``qview`` and
the coordinates of points that can be matched visually can be compared.
Subtract line,sample locations in the first image from the coordinates
of the same feature in the second image, and this will yield offsets
that can be used in the search range. Make several of these offset
measurements and use them to define a line,sample bounding box, then
expand this by 50% and use it for ``corr-search``. This will produce
good results in most images.

Also, if you are using an alignment option, you’ll instead want to make
those disparity measurements against the written L.tif and R.tif files
(see :numref:`outputfiles`) instead of the original input files.

.. _local_hom:

Local Homography
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Local homography decomposes the left image into tiles, and tries to find
the best homography transform from each tile to the right image before
computing the correlation. This is more fine-grained than using a global
homography transform.

This approach is experimental. We suggest instead the map-projection
approach be used (:numref:`mapproj-example`), as
that one is even more fine-grained, and does not suffer from artifacts
that may arise from the local homography piecewise approach.

This option can be turned on with the flag ``use-local-homography``.

.. _sgm:

Semi-Global Matching
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new option for integer stereo correlation available in ASP is the
popular semi-global matching algorithm introduced in
:cite:`hirschmuller_sgm_original`. The algorithm is not
typically used for DEM generation but it has been used successfully to
process HRSC images :cite:`hirschmuller_hrsc_with_sgm`. The
version of the algorithm implemented by ASP has a few modifications
relative to the original implementation. The most significant difference
is that ASP’s implementation performs a 2D disparity search, similar to
what is done in the NG-fSGM algorithm
:cite:`xiang_2016_low_complexity_fsgm`. Since ASP processes
a wide variety of cameras with varying degrees of metadata quality, the
standard assumption with SGM that the disparity search can be performed
only along a one-dimensional epipolar line does not hold. The other
major change is that ASP uses a multi- resolution hierarchical search
combined with a compressed memory scheme similar to what is used in the
SGM algorithm :cite:`rothermel2012sure_isgm`. With these
two features the SGM algorithm can be used for unrectified, larger
images. ASP also supports a mode using the MGM algorithm
:cite:`facciolo2015mgm`, referred to in some places in the
documentation as Smooth SGM. This algorithm reduces the amount of high
frequency artifacts in textureless regions at the cost of a longer run
time. ASP also offers the option of a hybrid SGM/MGM mode where MGM is
used only for the final resolution level which obtains results somewhere
between the pure SGM and MGM options.

The greatest advantage of the SGM algorithm over the normal ASP
correlation algorithm is an improved ability to find disparity matches
in areas of repetitive or low texture. SGM can also discern finer
resolution features than the standard correlation algorithm since it
tends to use much smaller matching kernels. Along with these advantages
come several disadvantages. First, SGM is computationally expensive and
requires a lot of memory. Second, in some situations it can produce
noticeable artifacts at tile boundaries. Third, it can sometimes produce
inaccurate results in textureless regions. With careful parameter
selection and usage these disadvantages can be mitigated.

In order to use SGM, pass in ``stereo-algorithm``. Use 1 to use SGM or 2
to use MGM. To process large images you must use the ``parallel_stereo``
program instead of the ``stereo`` program. ``parallel_stereo`` replaces
the refinement stage with a new seam blending stage to suppress
artifacts along tile borders. Without this step SGM can produce
artifacts along tile borders. The ``stereo`` program can be used as long
as the ``corr-tile-size`` command is set large enough to fit the entire
image into a single processing tile. When running SGM, a single ASP
process will handle only one tile at a time but it will use multiple
threads per tile, as opposed to normal stereo where each tile uses its
own thread. MGM is currently limited to using 8 simultaneous threads but
SGM does not have a limit. When running ``parallel_stereo`` use the
following options:

-  Specify the ``sgm-collar-size`` option or leave it at the default
   value. Increasing this value decreases the chances of seeing
   artifacts along tile borders but increases processing time and memory
   usage.

-  Set the ``corr-tile-size`` option to determine the tile size, keeping
   in mind that larger tile sizes produce better results but consume
   more memory. The collar size you selected will enlarge the processed
   tile size.

-  Set the ``processes`` option keeping in mind memory constraints as
   discussed earlier. Each process will run one simultaneous SGM
   instance and consume memory.

-  The ``corr-memory-limit-mb`` parameter limits the number of megabytes
   of memory that can be used by SGM/MGM. This limit is per-process. To
   be safe, make sure that you have more RAM available than the value of
   this parameter multiplied by the number of processes.

-  ``job-size-w`` and ``job-size-h`` are set equal to
   ``corr-tile-size``. Do not override them!

By setting these parameters in the manner described, each process will
generate a single SGM tile which will then be blended in the new blend
step. Each process can use multiple threads with
``threads-singleprocess`` without affecting the stereo results.

When SGM or MGM is specified, certain stereo parameters have their
default values replaced with values that will work with SGM. You can
still manually specify these options.

-  Cost Mode (default 4). Mean absolute distance (MAD)
   (``cost-mode <= 2``) usually does not work well. The census transform
   mode (``cost-mode 3``) :cite:`zabih1994census` tends to
   perform better overall but can produce artifacts on featureless
   terrain. The ternary census transform mode (``cost-mode 4``)
   :cite:`hua2016texture` is a modification of the census
   transform that is more stable on low contrast terrain but may be less
   accurate elsewhere.

-  Kernel size. SGM kernels must always be symmetric. The SGM algorithm
   works with much smaller kernel sizes than the regular integer
   correlator so the default large kernel is not recommended. The MAD
   cost mode can be used with any odd kernel size (including size 1) but
   the census cost modes can only be used with kernel sizes 3, 5, 7, and
   9. Size 7 is usually a good choice.

-  Xcorr-Threshold. By default, this is disabled in order to nearly
   halve the (long) run time of the SGM algorithm. Set
   ``xcorr-threshold`` to >= 0 to turn it back on. If you set the
   ``min-xcorr-level`` parameter to 1 you can perform cross correlation
   on the smaller resolution levels without spending the time to run it
   on the largest resolution level.

-  The median and texture filters in the ``stereo_fltr`` tool (defaults
   3, 11, 0.13). These filters were designed specifically to clean up
   output from the SGM algorithm and are especially useful in
   suppressing image artifacts in low-texture portions of the image. A
   median filter size of 3 and a texture filter size of 11 are good
   starts but the best values will depend on your input images. The
   ``texture-smooth-scale`` parameter will have to be adjusted to taste,
   but a range of 0.13 to 0.15 is typical for icy images. These values
   are enabled by default and must be manually disabled. If your images
   have good texture throughout it may be best to disable these filters.

-  The ``prefilter-mode`` setting is ignored when using SGM.

-  The ``subpixel-mode`` If not set or set to values 7-12 SGM will
   perform subpixel interpolation during the stereo correlation step and
   will not do additional work in the stereo refinement step. This means
   that after dealing with the long SGM processing time you do not need
   to follow it up with a slow subpixel option! If desired, you can
   specify modes 1-4 to force those subpixel operations to be performed
   after the default SGM subpixel method.

.. figure:: images/correlation/icebridge_example_crop.png
   :name: corr-sgm-example

   A section of a NASA IceBridge image on the left with a pair of 
   hill-shaded DEMs to the right it showing the difference between default 
   ASP processing (upper right) and processing using the SGM algorithm 
   (lower right).

:numref:`corr-sgm-example` shows a comparison between two
stereo modes. The DEM on the left was generated using the default stereo
parameters and ``--subpixel-mode 3``. The DEM on the right was generated
using the command::

     stereo --stereo-algorithm 1 --threads 1 --xcorr-threshold -1 --corr-kernel 7 7 \
     --corr-tile-size 6400 --cost-mode 4 --median-filter-size 3   \
     --texture-smooth-size 13 --texture-smooth-scale 0.13

Some grid pattern noise is visible in the image produced using SGM.
Using ``--stereo-algorithm 2`` should reduce it. And, as mentioned
earlier, for large images which won’t fit in memory,
``--corr-tile-size`` can be set to a value like 4096, and
``parallel_stereo`` should be used.

.. _subpixel:

Sub-pixel Refinement
--------------------

Once disparity map initialization is complete, every pixel in the
disparity map will either have an estimated disparity value, or it will
be marked as invalid. All valid pixels are then adjusted in the
sub-pixel refinement stage based on the ``subpixel-mode`` setting.

The first mode is parabola-fitting sub-pixel refinement
(``subpixel-mode 1``). This technique fits a 2D parabola to points on
the correlation cost surface in an 8-connected neighborhood around the
cost value that was the “best” as measured during disparity map
initialization. The parabola’s minimum can then be computed analytically
and taken as as the new sub-pixel disparity value.

This method is easy to implement and extremely fast to compute, but it
exhibits a problem known as pixel-locking: the sub-pixel disparities
tend toward their integer estimates and can create noticeable “stair
steps” on surfaces that should be smooth
:cite:`Stein06:attenuating,Szeliski03sampling`. See for
example :numref:`parabola_subpixel`.
Furthermore, the parabola subpixel mode is not capable of refining a
disparity estimate by more than one pixel, so although it produces
smooth disparity maps, these results are not much more accurate than the
results that come out of the disparity map initialization in the first
place. However, the speed of this method makes it very useful as a
“draft” mode for quickly generating a DEM for visualization (i.e.
non-scientific) purposes. It is also beneficial in the event that a user
will simply downsample their DEM after generation in Stereo Pipeline.

.. figure:: images/correlation/parabola_results.png
  :name: parabola_subpixel

  Left: Input images.  Center: results using the parabola draft
  subpixel mode (subpixel-mode = 1). Right: results using the Bayes
  EM high quality subpixel mode (subpixel-mode = 2).


For high quality results, we recommend ``subpixel-mode 2``: the Bayes EM
weighted affine adaptive window correlator. This advanced method
produces extremely high quality stereo matches that exhibit a high
degree of immunity to image noise. For example Apollo Metric Camera
images are affected by two types of noise inherent to the scanning
process: (1) the presence of film grain and (2) dust and lint particles
present on the film or scanner. The former gives rise to noise in the
DEM values that wash out real features, and the latter causes incorrect
matches or hard to detect blemishes in the DEM. Attenuating the effect
of these scanning artifacts while simultaneously refining the integer
disparity map to sub-pixel accuracy has become a critical goal of our
system, and is necessary for processing real-world data sets such as the
Apollo Metric Camera data.

The Bayes EM subpixel correlator also features a deformable template
window from the left image that can be rotated, scaled, and translated
as it zeros in on the correct match in the right image. This adaptive
window is essential for computing accurate matches on crater or canyon
walls, and on other areas with significant perspective distortion due to
foreshortening.

This affine-adaptive behavior is based on the Lucas-Kanade template
tracking algorithm, a classic algorithm in the field of computer vision
:cite:`Baker04:lucas-kanade`. We have extended this
technique; developing a Bayesian model that treats the Lucas-Kanade
parameters as random variables in an Expectation Maximization (EM)
framework. This statistical model also includes a Gaussian mixture
component to model image noise that is the basis for the robustness of
our algorithm. We will not go into depth on our approach here, but we
encourage interested readers to read our papers on the topic
:cite:`nefian:bayes_em,broxton:isvc09`.

However we do note that, like the computations in the disparity map
initialization stage, we adopt a multi-scale approach for sub-pixel
refinement. At each level of the pyramid, the algorithm is initialized
with the disparity determined in the previous lower resolution level of
the pyramid, thereby allowing the subpixel algorithm to shift the
results of the disparity initialization stage by many pixels if a better
match can be found using the affine, noise-adapted window. Hence, this
sub-pixel algorithm is able to significantly improve upon the results to
yield a high quality, high resolution result.

Another option when run time is important is ``subpixel-mode 3``: the
simple affine correlator. This is essentially the Bayes EM mode with the
noise correction features removed in order to decrease the required run
time. In data sets with little noise this mode can yield results similar
to Bayes EM mode in approximately one fifth the time.

A different option is Phase Correlation, ``subpixel-mode 4``, which
implements the algorithm from :cite:`guizar2008efficient`.
It is slow and does not work well on slopes but since the algorithm is
very different it might perform in situations where the other algorithms
are not working well.

Triangulation
-------------

When running an ISIS session, the Stereo Pipeline uses geometric camera
models available in ISIS :cite:`anderson08:isis`. These
highly accurate models are customized for each instrument that ISIS
supports. Each ISIS “cube” file contains all of the information that is
required by the Stereo Pipeline to find and use the appropriate camera
model for that observation.

Other sessions such as DG (*DigitalGlobe*) or Pinhole, require that
their camera model be provided as additional arguments to the ``stereo``
command. Those camera models come in the form of an XML document for DG
and as ``*.pinhole, *.tsai, *.cahv, *.cahvor`` for Pinhole sessions.
Those files must be the third and forth arguments or immediately follow
after the 2 input images for ``stereo``.

.. figure:: images/correlation/camera_models.png
   :name: camera_models
   :alt: Camera Models

   Most remote sensing cameras fall into two generic categories
   based on their basic geometry.  Framing cameras (left) capture an
   instantaneous two-dimensional image.  Linescan cameras (right)
   capture images one scan line at a time, building up an image over
   the course of several seconds as the satellite moves through the
   sky.

ISIS camera models account for all aspects of camera geometry, including
both intrinsic (i.e. focal length, pixel size, and lens distortion) and
extrinsic (e.g. camera position and orientation) camera parameters.
Taken together, these parameters are sufficient to “forward project” a
3D point in the world onto the image plane of the sensor. It is also
possible to “back project” from the camera’s center of projection
through a pixel corresponding to the original 3D point.

.. figure:: images/correlation/triangulation_400px.png

   :alt: Triangulation

   Once a disparity map has been generated and refined, it can be used
   in combination with the geometric camera models to compute the
   locations of 3D points on the surface of Mars. This figure shows the
   position (at the origins of the red, green, and blue vectors) and
   orientation of the Mars Global Surveyor at two points in time where
   it captured images in a stereo pair.

Notice, however, that forward and back projection are not symmetric
operations. One camera is sufficient to “image” a 3D point onto a pixel
located on the image plane, but the reverse is not true. Given only a
single camera and a pixel location :math:`x = (u,v),` that is the image
of an unknown 3D point :math:`P = (x,y,z)`, it is only possible to
determine that :math:`P` lies somewhere along a ray that emanates from
the camera’s center of projection through the pixel location :math:`x`
on the image plane (see :numref:`camera_models`).

Alas, once images are captured, the route from image pixel back to
3D points in the real world is through back projection, so we must
bring more information to bear on the problem of uniquely reconstructing
our 3D point. In order to determine :math:`P` using back projection,
we need *two* cameras that both contain pixel locations :math:`x_1`
and :math:`x_2` where :math:`P` was imaged. Now, we have two rays
that converge on a point in 3D space (see :numref:`triangulation`).
The location where they meet must be the original location of
:math:`P`.

In practice, the two rays rarely intersect perfectly because any slight
error in the camera position or pointing information will effect the
rays’ positions as well. Instead, we take the *closest point of
intersection* of the two rays as the location of point :math:`P`.

Additionally, the actual distance between the rays at this point is an
interesting and important error metric that measures how self-consistent
our two camera models are for this point. You will learn in the next
chapter that this information, when computed and averaged over all
reconstructed 3D points, can be a valuable statistic for determining
whether to carry out bundle adjustment. Distance between the two rays at
their closest intersection is recorded in the fourth channel of the
point cloud file, ``output-prefix-PC.tif``. This information can be
brought to the same perspective as the output DEM by using the *--error*
argument on the ``point2dem`` command.

This error in the triangulation, the distance between two rays, *is
not the true accuracy of the DEM*. It is only another indirect
measure of quality. A DEM with high triangulation error is always
bad and should have its images bundle-adjusted. A DEM with low
triangulation error is at least self consistent but could still be
bad. A map of the triangulation error should only be interpreted
as a relative measurement. Where small areas are found with high
triangulation error came from correlation mistakes and large areas
of error came from camera model inadequacies.
