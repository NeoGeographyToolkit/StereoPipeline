.. _pc_filter:

pc_filter
---------

This program takes as input a four-band ``PC.tif`` point cloud as
created by stereo triangulation (:numref:`outputfiles`) and applies
various outlier filters. It can be especially useful for indoor stereo
datasets, which can have poor texture and very oblique angles, and
hence result in noisy point clouds.

Each point that is kept can be assigned a reliability weight (for some
of the options below), which will be used when the point clouds (if in
``.pcd`` format) are fused into a mesh with ``voxblox_mesh``
(:numref:`voxblox_mesh`).

It is assumed that the input cloud fits fully in memory, and some
filtering options expect that the cloud was created with pinhole
cameras. This may change in future versions.

The output cloud has the same format and dimensions as the input, with
outliers replaced by points with all coordinates equal to 0. The cloud
can also be saved in ``.ply`` or ``.pcd`` format (depending on the
specified extension). In those cases the coordinates are saved as
``float32``, which may result in loss of precision for orbital
data. Invalid points and outliers are excluded from those clouds.

A textured mesh in .obj format can be created from the output cloud
using ``point2mesh`` (:numref:`point2mesh`), just as for the original
cloud.

Usage::

    pc_filter [options] --input-cloud input.tif --output-cloud output.tif

Example 1 (save the output in .tif format)::

    pc_filter --max-distance-from-camera 1.5      \
      --max-camera-ray-to-surface-normal-angle 75 \
      --input-cloud run/run-PC.tif                \
      --input-texture run/run-L.tif               \
      --camera left.tsai                          \
      --output-cloud run/run-PC-filter.tif

Example 2 (save the output in .pcd format and transform to camera coordinates,
for use with VoxBlox)::

    pc_filter --max-distance-from-camera 1.5      \
      --max-camera-ray-to-surface-normal-angle 75 \
      --input-cloud run/run-PC.tif                \
      --input-texture run/run-L.tif               \
      --transform-to-camera-coordinates           \
      --output-cloud run/run-PC-filter.pcd

Create a mesh from the filtered point cloud::

    point2mesh -s 4 --texture-step-size 1          \
               run/run-PC-filter.tif run/run-L.tif

Command-line options for ``pc_filter``:

--input-cloud <string (default="")>
    Input cloud name. A four-band .tif file as produced by stereo
    triangulation.

--output-cloud <string (default="")>
    Output cloud name. If having a .tif extension, the same format will
    be used as the input. Can also save ``.pcd`` and ``.ply`` files
    (only vertices are saved, not mesh faces). In those
    case the points will be saved with ``float32`` values, so there may be
    some precision loss. The ``.pcd`` file will store in the field for the
    cloud normal the values image_texture, blending_weight,
    intersection_error, assuming these are computed.

--input-texture <string (default="")>
    If specified, read the texture from this file. Normally this is the
    file ``L.tif`` from the same run which produced the input point
    cloud.

--camera <string (default="")>
    The left or right camera used to produce this cloud. Used for some
    filtering operations.

--max-distance-from-camera <double (default=0.0)>
    If positive, remove points further from camera center than this
    value. Measured in meters.

--max-valid-triangulation-error <double (default=0.0)>
    If positive, points with triangulation error larger than this will
    be removed from the cloud. Measured in meters.

--max-camera-ray-to-surface-normal-angle <double (default=0.0)>
    If positive, points whose surface normal makes an angle with the
    ray back to the camera center greater than this will be removed as
    outliers. Measured in degrees.

--max-camera-dir-to-surface-normal-angle <double (default=0.0)>
    If positive, points whose surface normal makes an angle with the
    camera direction greater than this will be removed as
    outliers. This eliminates surfaces almost parallel to camera view
    direction. Measured in degrees.

--max-camera-dir-to-camera-ray-angle <double (default=0.0)>
    If positive, and a ray emanating from the camera and ending at the
    current point makes an angle with the camera direction bigger than
    this, remove the point as an outlier. In effect, this narrows the
    camera field of view.

--distance-from-camera-weight-power <double (default=0.0)>
    If positive, let the weight of a point be inversely proportional
    to the distance from the camera center to the point, raised to
    this power.

--blending-dist <double (default=0.0)>
    If positive and closer to any boundary of valid points than this
    (measured in point cloud pixels), decrease the weight assigned to
    the given point proportionally to remaining distance to boundary
    raised to a power. In effect, points closer to boundary are given
    less weight. Used in VoxBlox.

--blending-power <double (default=1.0)>
    Use this as the power when setting ``--blending-dist``.

--reliable-surface-resolution <double (default=0.0)>
    If positive, let each point's weight be proportional to
    exp(-curr_surface_resolution / reliable_surface_resolution). This
    should be set to about half the expected surface resolution, to
    have the weight of points at lower resolution decrease rather
    fast. A point's surface resolution is the maximum distance between
    it and its immediate neighbors.

--transform-to-camera-coordinates
    Transform the point cloud to the coordinate system of the camera
    provided with ``--camera``. For use with VoxBlox.

--output-weight <string (default="")>
    If specified, save the weight assigned to each point to this
    file. This has the same dimensions as the point cloud and ``L.tif``.
    (Use the .tif extension.)

--threads <integer (default: 0)>
    Select the number of threads to use for each process. If 0, use
    the value in ~/.vwrc.
 
--cache-size-mb <integer (default = 1024)>
    Set the system cache size, in MB.

--tile-size <integer (default: 256 256)>
    Image tile size used for multi-threaded processing.

--no-bigtiff
    Tell GDAL to not create BigTiff files.

--tif-compress <None|LZW|Deflate|Packbits (default: LZW)>
    TIFF compression method.

-v, --version
    Display the version of software.

-h, --help
    Display this help message.
